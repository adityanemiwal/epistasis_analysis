# Epistasis Analysis
Say we have a original genome sequence M

First Situation: 
- Choose two mutations A, B
- Study the epistasis nature between mutation A and B

Second Situation:
- There is a background mutation X present in M
- Study XA, XB and XAB to find the epistasis nature between A and B now

Analyse how nature of epistasis between A, B change in presence of X
